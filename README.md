# CJ Salas - salasberryfin

I love Linux, Neovim and programming in Go and Python.
I'm passionate about learning anything and I think that breaking stuff is the fastest way to really understand new technologies, so I spend lots of time tweaking things until I get the hang of them.

I'm pretty sure you can get anywhere with a **Linux** machine + **Neovim**.
